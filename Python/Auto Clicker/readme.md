# Trying to create a cool auto clicker.

## Currently there are some delay issues preventing the F2 to stop the clicker.

### Usage

In order to use it , you can download the python file but you will have to install 'pyinstaller':
- pip install pyinstaller
Afterwards you will have to run the following command:
- pyinstaller --onefile auto-clicker.py

In my case on Windows 10 I used:
- python -m PyInstaller --onefile auto-clicker.py

Which created a folder with all the necessary files and the exe to run it.

# Add more monitoring and scaling logic

# Write a Bash script that dynamically scales the number of instances in a server cluster based on workload. The script should monitor resource usage and adjust the cluster size as needed.
# Scaling infrastructure dynamically is often achieved through cloud provider auto-scaling features. Above is a very simplified bash script that uses AWS CLI to adjust instance count based on CPU utilization.

# Combined DevOps Automation Script for `bash-1.sh`

This script combines multiple DevOps automation tasks into a single script for convenience and workflow streamlining. The script is designed to work in conjunction with the `bash-1.sh` file and performs the following tasks:

1. **Automated Backup Task:**
   - Creates a backup of specified files and directories.
   - Destination: /path/to/backup
   - Source: /path/to/source

2. **Data Syncing Task:**
   - Syncs data between source and destination directories.
   - Source: /path/to/source
   - Destination: /path/to/destination

3. **Log Rotation Task:**
   - Rotates log files, keeping a specified number of backups.
   - Log Directory: /path/to/logs
   - Maximum Log Files: 5

4. **Database Backup Task:**
   - Performs a backup of a MySQL database using mysqldump.
   - Destination: /path/to/db_backups
   - Database User: username
   - Database Name: database_name

5. **Cleanup Task:**
   - Cleans up files older than a specified number of days.
   - Temp Directory: /path/to/temp
   - Maximum Age: 7 days

Each task is executed sequentially, and a message is displayed when each task starts and completes. The script is designed to ensure that each task is started only after the previous task has successfully completed.

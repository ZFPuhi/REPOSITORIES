# Hey there :wave:

### Sync your fork's develop branch (if front/back end repos)
To fully sync the fork that you have previously created for the desired repo on which you will be working, you have to simply navigate to it. In my example case, to access the fork I can simply
click on my Github Username on the top left side of the screen and then click on the 'diablo4trading-fe' repo that is showing on my profile.
Once you have entered the forked repository located on your Github account, you can sync it by simply clicking on the drop-down arrow next to "Sync fork".
As you can see from the screenshot below in my case I am up to date and there is nothing to sync from the Project branch.

# You will want to create a develop branch on your forked repo, if not done already.
In order to create a new branch on the Forked repository, you can follow the previous steps to enter into the repository folder and afterwards simply click on the '1 branch' located right next to your 'master/main' drop-down menu as shown on the screenshot below.

After you have clicked on the '1 branch' you will be redirected to a page where all the branches created for the repository in question, in my case I have only 1 branch 'main' so lets create a new one.

</p>

To do that I have to simply click on the green button "New branch" which will open the popup displayed below on the screenshot. As displayed on the screenshot the first thing that you want to perform is to name the branch, in my case I will be adding a new language so I have typed in 'feature/additional-language'. The other two options below 'Source' I am not changing as they are saying from which Repository the branch will be created and from which branch as some projects might have more than 1 branch.
